<h1>About  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px"></h1>
<p align="center">
HyperMC is a Minecraft Extention manager. Downloading assests then putting them into the right folders can be time consuming and annoying. With HyperMC you can do it almost instantly! Choose your asset, press "Add" and your all set!
</p>

<h1>What makes us different?  </h1>
<p align="center">
HyperMC is a Minecraft Extention manager. Not only does it mean that we have mods but we have other things such as new versions, apis, mods, resourcepacks, and shaders. We will also have a custom file type that you can use to download mod packs made by others.
</p>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<h1>Why should you download?</h1>
<p align="center">
Although this is a young project we are still developing. Since we are so young that means we are constantly updating and adding new features and fixing bugs.

<h1>Inspiration</h1>
<p align="center">
Im a big KSP fan. I love new things. Put those together you get game mods. I got really annoyed downloading a ton of files and putting the gamedata folder so I looked up an alternative solution. Thats when I found CKAN (The Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network). I fell in love with it. Then my brain went, "What if I do the samething with one of my all time favourite games. Minecraft". So I started development
