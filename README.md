<h1>About  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px"></h1>

<h1>What makes us different?  </h1>
<p align="center">
HyperMC is a Minecraft Extention manager. Not only does it mean that we have mods but we have other things such as new versions, apis, mods, resourcepacks, and shaders. We will also have a custom file type that you can use to download mod packs made by others/

Although this is a young project we are still developing. Since we are so young that means we are constantly updating and adding new features and fixing bugs.

<h1>Inspiration</h1>
<p align="center">
Im a big KSP fan. I love new things. Put those together you get game mods. I got really annoyed downloading a ton of files and putting the gamedata folder so I looked up an alternative solution. Thats when I found CKAN (The Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network). I fell in love with it. Then my brain went, "What if I do the samething with one of my all time favourite games. Minecraft". So I started development
